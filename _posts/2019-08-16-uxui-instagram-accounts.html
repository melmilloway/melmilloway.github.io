Every morning I make my social media rounds. LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram. 

I love scrolling through my Instagram feed. It's a happy place. I get to see snapshots of one of my close couple friends on their honeymoon in Italy. I tap through stories of my colleague's dog cozying up with a stuffed animal. 

Instagram isn't just for pictures of food, family, friends, and fun times. There is an abundance of educational content too.
