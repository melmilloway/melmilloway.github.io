<p class="intro">I am finally on the Adobe Capture CC bandwagon.</p>

<p>Adobe Capture CC uses the camera of your phone to take pictures to create different assets that can be using in Adobe products. The assets you can create are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Shapes</li>
  <li>Patterns</li>
  <li>Color Palettes</li>
  <li>Brushes</li>
  <li>Looks (What I presume to be video filters for Adobe Premiere, but I haven't tried this one yet)</li>
</ol>

<p>When I first heard about Adobe Capture CC, I was skeptical but I knew that I needed to give it a whirl to truly know if it were hit or miss. Every floor in our office building has completely different wallpaper. So, one afternoon I decided to put the app to the test and create icons out of our wallpaper. I ran around our building snapping all of the wallpaper images just to test out the app. The icons created from the images turned out so awesome. That's when I was converted.</p>

<p>Although I have not used the icons for anything, I have started using the app again for some personal projects. If you have an Adobe CC account you should totally take advantage of their mobile apps like Adobe Capture CC.</p>

<p>Check out some of the features of Adobe Capture CC in my short video overview.</p>

<p>What do you do after you create a shape? (Sorry for the scratching noises in the vid... my mouse was not moving properly.)</p>

<p>Right now I am really into capturing doodles because it fits in with the branding of my new site. I'm also creating a wilderness survival themed choose your own adventure game and utilizing the Shapes feature to create images for it.</p>

<p>My game will be in black and white with handrawn images, so the doodles really fit in well.</p>

<p>Here's a mockup of the loader for my choose your own adventure, so that you can see how the doodles fit in. It's going to look way better animated, trust me.</p>

<p>There are many ways you can get creative with using Adobe Capture CC. Here are some ideas in using it to create elearning assets:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create characters and backgrounds (or ask someone you know who is talented at drawing to)</li>
  <li>Make icons</li>
  <li>Use a handwritten style or create your own stylized graphics</li>
  <li>Find a color scheme for your course from anywhere at any time</li>
  <li>Make subtle backgrounds for your course with the Pattern feature</li>
</ol>
