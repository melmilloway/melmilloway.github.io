2020 has been a long year. I think we can all agree on that one. Typically at the end of each year I write a reflection post that covers all of the things I've done throughout the year. This year I find myself reflecting more on past years. Reminiscing about travel and the time I got to spend with folks in the learning community. So this year I'm forgoing my typical reflection post and opting to review an older passion project of mine.
