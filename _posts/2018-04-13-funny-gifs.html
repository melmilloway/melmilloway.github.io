<p class="intro">Having to do voice overs is something I ~dread~.</p>

<p> I sometimes record voice overs for animated videos and screen recordings but thankfully it's not a huge part of my job. Whenever I do record a voice over, it's quite the trip. There are all kinds of emotional stages "Non" Voice Over Artists go through when recording voice overs, especially when you don't have a studio to record in.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite people in my learning network are Voice Over Artists.  I really admire Voice Over Artists for their skills and talents. Creating a great voice over requires a lot of things to go right and skills.</p>

<p>In honor of all the Voice Over Artists out there, this post is dedicated to you! Here are all of the phases Non Voice Over Artists going through when recording (Okay, maybe the pros go through some of these too, at least every now and again. ðŸ˜‰)</p>
