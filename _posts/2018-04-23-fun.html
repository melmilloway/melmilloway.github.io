<p class="intro">One of my goals for the year has been to ramp up my skills in After Effects. I use After Effects to create short animated explainer videos and motion graphics for other projects. </p>

<p> In order to get started in After Effects I took LinkedIn Learning's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/after-effects-cc-2018-essential-training-motion-graphics" target="_blank">After Effects CC 2018 Essential Training: Motion Graphics</a>. I highly recommend going through the essential course or having some experience in After Effects prior to trying the following tutorials.</p>

<p>I decided to go with a coffee theme for all of my examples since I love coffee ❤️☕. Have some fun with your projects and personalize them.</p>

<p>Are you ready? Get started!</p>

<h2>I started with one of the easiest tutorials, the Bouncy Animated Text tutorial</h2>

<p>Here is my rendition:</p>

<h2> Next I moved onto the Rising and Falling text tutorial</h2>

<p>And here is my example:</p>

<h2>Finally, I finished with this Slot Machine style animation.</h2>

<p>Here is my take on it:</p>
