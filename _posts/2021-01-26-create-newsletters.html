In 2017 Morning Brewâ€™s newsletter had 100,000 subscribers, within 18 months they grew to 1.5 million subscribers. Morning Brew delivers a newsletter that provides professionals engaging, entertaining business news. Growth.Design shares an amazing case study on what makes Morning Brew a winner; including their tone of voice, catchy titles, and easy reading format. I was really intrigued with how a newsletter could generate so many subscribers. It even had me analyzing newsletters that I subscribed to.
