<p class="intro">Over the past few months I have been curating articles and resources to help me learn more about UX design.</p>

<p>UX is an important part of digital learning experiences. Good UX in learning can help remove barriers for our learners in navigating to the content they need and so much more. Join me on the next eLearning Guild <a href="https://www.elearningguild.com/content/5498/spotlight-2018---exploring-user-experience-design" target="_blank">Spotlight on UX Design</a> on Aug 1.</p>
