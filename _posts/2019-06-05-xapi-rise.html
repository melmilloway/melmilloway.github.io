<p class="intro"><a href="https://rise.articulate.com/" target="_blank">Articulate Rise</a> is a web based elearning authoring tool that allows you to create responsive elearning. It's also a great option for creating performance support materials.</p>

<p>Performance support materials help users accomplish goals in real time through easy access and quick referencing. Materials can be created in Rise and hosted outside of a Learning Management System for easy access by users but how do we know they are being used and if they're making an impact?</p>

<p>That's where xAPI comes in. By adding a bit of code to Rise's published index.html file you can track page views and more.</p>

<p>In the following tutorial I cover how to send page view statements. In a future post I'll cover tracking more.</p>

<p>Use the following<a href="https://github.com/melmilloway/xapi" target="_blank">materials</a>referenced in the tutorial to get started.</p>
