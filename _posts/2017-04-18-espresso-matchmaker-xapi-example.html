<p class="intro">I created several videos on how to add custom xAPI to Storyline that will be on an upcoming post on <a href="https://elearningindustry.com/" target="_blank">eLearning Industry</a>. In the meantime, check out the project associated with the videos and see some live statements at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>I created the <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/storylinexapiexample/Espresso-Matchmaker/launcher.html" target="_blank">Espresso Matchmaker</a> in Storyline 2 and the output is HTML5. The project uses xAPI to track what users select (using Wax LRS), what their drink outcome is, and if they replay the project.</p> 
<p>The actor or user in the project is randomized, using some JavaScript that randomized an email address and appends a number between 1 and 5000 to the email. The postive of this is you don't need SSO and users remain anonymous. The negative is that you won't get much user info and if a user returns to the project they will have a different random actor name.</p>
<p>There are many uses for xAPI in learning projects, especially when it comes to noticing data trends that you can further investigate. e.g. If you see a majority people are interacting with a software simulation in a way that was not intended you can investigate if it is a system issue or a training issue.</p>
<p>I'll talk more about executing xAPI with Storyline and uses in my article on eLearning Industry. Be on the lookout for the article!</p>
