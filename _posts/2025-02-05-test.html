    <h1>Case Study: Leveraging GenAI for Rapid Course Development on Feline Diabetes Management</h1>
    <p><strong>Author:</strong> [Your Name] | <strong>Date:</strong> [Date]</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Feline Fancy Veterinary Clinic aimed to reduce emergency visits related to feline diabetes through an educational initiative targeting cat owners. By leveraging AI-driven tools and an agile instructional design approach, we created an interactive e-learning course to bridge the knowledge gap. Typically, a project of this scale would take three months to develop, but with the strategic use of GenAI tools and the absence of traditional stakeholder alignment cycles, we completed the first course in just 13 days.</p>

    <h2>Project Goals & Business Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Strategic Goal:</strong> Reduce emergency visits by 10% (7,000 fewer visits out of 70,000) to decrease operating costs by $150,000–$200,000 annually.</li>
      <li><strong>Diabetes-Specific Goal:</strong> Achieve a 20% reduction in diabetes-related emergency visits, preventing approximately 1,400 cases.</li>
      <li><strong>Learning Opportunity:</strong> Research indicated that 25% of owners of diabetic cats lacked essential management knowledge, highlighting the need for targeted education.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lessons Learned & Future Applications</h2>
    <p>This project demonstrated the power of GenAI in transforming instructional design efficiency. While the lack of real-time stakeholder review cycles enabled rapid execution, future iterations would benefit from structured feedback loops to enhance alignment with broader organizational goals. The success of this initiative underscores the potential of AI-driven content creation in veterinary education and beyond.</p>
