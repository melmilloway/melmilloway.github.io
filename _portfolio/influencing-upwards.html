It combines GenAI-driven chat interactions (Gemini API) and AI-powered video avatars (Colossyan) to provide a realistic role-play experience. Learners step into the role of an analyst at a fictional space data startup, Galaxia Analytics, where they must present strategic recommendations to leadership and respond to executive follow-up questions in real-time. The course focuses on persuasive communication, executive influence, and decision-making alignment, offering immediate feedback through a personalized AI-generated performance report."
