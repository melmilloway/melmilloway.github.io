    <p>My style is a little quirky. I like art, documentaries, travelling, coffee, trying new food, and did I mention coffee?</p>
    <p>I'm constantly teaching myself new skills. I'm currently digging learning more in After Effects. When I'm not learning a new skill you can find me attemping to cook new dish or exploring the Emerald city.</p>
