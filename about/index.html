    <h2>Hi. I'm Mel.</h2>
    <p class="intro">I'm originally from Pennsylvania but now I live in the state of Washington. I love researching UX design, crafting mock-ups, and developing learning products using different technologies. I blog about new tools I am testing out, free resources, and my own musings about the field of Learning and Development.</p>

    <p>My style is a little quirky. I like art, documentaries, traveling, coffee, trying new food, and did I mention coffee?</p>
