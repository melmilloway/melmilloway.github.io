00:05.700 --> 00:06.333
there you are.

00:06.333 --> 00:09.233
Analyst number 49. Thank you for joining.

00:09.233 --> 00:10.333
We have a critical decision

00:10.333 --> 00:13.466
to make about our expansion
into precision agriculture for Q3.

00:13.900 --> 00:16.900
The board expects a clear recommendation
on our strategy.

00:17.233 --> 00:19.233
The opportunity is huge.

00:19.233 --> 00:20.733
Our latest satellite analytics

00:20.733 --> 00:24.366
model has the potential
to improve crop yield predictions by 18%.

00:24.766 --> 00:27.233
But execution will determine our success.

00:27.233 --> 00:30.233
We need to decide how to position
this to investors and clients.

00:30.966 --> 00:34.200
Elara Voss,
otherwise known as Executive Number one,

00:34.400 --> 00:37.400
will be reviewing our final recommendation
in the next meeting.

00:37.466 --> 00:39.933
She'll want a clear,
well-structured answer.

00:39.933 --> 00:40.800
No uncertainty.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.200
No hesitation.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.700
We need to get ahead of her questions now.

00:44.700 --> 00:47.866
Do we scale aggressively
focusing on global partnerships?

00:48.333 --> 00:52.233
Or do we take a targeted approach proving
value in high impact regions first?

00:53.100 --> 00:56.966
The analysis you shared last week
is strong, but analysis isn't enough.

00:57.933 --> 00:59.866
Elara doesn't just want insights.

00:59.866 --> 01:02.166
She wants a recommendation she can act on.

01:02.166 --> 01:03.300
She moves fast.

01:03.300 --> 01:07.500
She expects clarity, a clear path forward,
not an information dump.

01:08.833 --> 01:12.033
How we frame this will define
the next phase of galaxy expansion.

01:12.900 --> 01:15.066
We have multiple ways
we could approach this.

01:15.066 --> 01:17.133
I need you to be
ready. What's our next move?
