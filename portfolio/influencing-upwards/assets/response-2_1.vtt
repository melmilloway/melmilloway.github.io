00:04.966 --> 00:07.900
So you think we should start
with high value regions where satellite

00:07.900 --> 00:13.166
data has the strongest impact proving
value before scaling a measured approach.

00:13.366 --> 00:15.566
Conservative but efficient.

00:15.566 --> 00:18.000
Focus on high value regions. Collect data.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.200
Expand intelligently.

00:20.200 --> 00:23.200
This minimizes risk
while maximizing credibility.

00:23.400 --> 00:26.400
It's orderly. I like order.

00:26.400 --> 00:30.833
My only question is how quickly
can we expand beyond the test markets?
