00:05.366 --> 00:08.700
So you think before expanding,
we should run additional trials

00:08.700 --> 00:12.833
to refine our model, then present stronger
data to investors for funding.

00:13.633 --> 00:15.700
I guess I see the logic.

00:15.700 --> 00:18.566
More data means a stronger investor pitch.

00:18.566 --> 00:22.733
Investors like strong data,
but they also like fast decisions

00:23.233 --> 00:26.233
and moving first.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.400
If we wait, we risk losing
first mover advantage.

00:29.866 --> 00:32.366
The board may interpret
this as hesitation.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.500
Hesitation implies uncertainty.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.500
Uncertainty implies vulnerable.

00:38.400 --> 00:39.666
Can we afford that delay?
