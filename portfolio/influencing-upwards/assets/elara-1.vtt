00:05.633 --> 00:07.733
Analyst number 49.

00:07.733 --> 00:09.266
I heard about your work from analyst.

00:09.266 --> 00:12.266
Manager number 433.

00:13.200 --> 00:14.533
We've run the models.

00:14.533 --> 00:16.900
The data suggests multiple ways forward.

00:16.900 --> 00:19.200
But data alone isn't enough.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.200
We need a strategy that actually
makes sense for the business.

00:22.933 --> 00:25.566
And before you answer, know this.

00:25.566 --> 00:28.566
Whatever we choose, the board
will expect us to stand behind it.

00:28.900 --> 00:29.800
No hedging?

00:29.800 --> 00:31.600
No. It depends.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.900
So tell me, what's the move?

00:33.900 --> 00:34.933
You've seen the data.

00:34.933 --> 00:37.866
You understand
the stakes. Now convince me.
