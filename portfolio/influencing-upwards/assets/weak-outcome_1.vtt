00:05.200 --> 00:06.233
I'll be honest.

00:06.233 --> 00:08.266
This isn't what Elara is looking for.

00:08.266 --> 00:10.700
Your approach
raises more risks than solutions.

00:10.700 --> 00:13.700
And we can't afford uncertainty
at this stage.

00:13.700 --> 00:16.700
A strong recommendation connects strategy
to execution.

00:17.333 --> 00:18.533
This approach didn't provide

00:18.533 --> 00:21.666
enough clarity on how we maintain momentum
while managing risks.

00:22.266 --> 00:24.100
Elara needs a different direction.

00:24.100 --> 00:25.300
Take a step back.

00:25.300 --> 00:26.900
Look at what she actually needs.

00:26.900 --> 00:28.933
Refine your thinking.

00:28.933 --> 00:30.700
Then let's revisit this.

00:30.700 --> 00:32.733
It looks like Elara's pinging you.

00:32.733 --> 00:33.500
You better go.
