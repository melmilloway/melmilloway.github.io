00:05.900 --> 00:08.500
Leadership
wasn't evaluating just your decision.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.266
They were evaluating how you framed it.

00:10.266 --> 00:13.266
Justified it and aligned it to business
priorities.

00:13.533 --> 00:16.533
Let's break down what should have happened
and why it matters.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.500
Your opening statement sets the tone.

00:19.500 --> 00:22.133
A strong recommendation looks like this.

00:22.133 --> 00:23.433
Move forward.

00:23.433 --> 00:26.433
Market
analysis shows a 20% increase in demand.

00:27.233 --> 00:31.166
Moving forward now ensures we secure
early adopters before competitors react.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.566
This will be a phased
rollout, prioritizing high revenue

00:34.566 --> 00:37.566
regions and mitigating execution risks.

00:37.566 --> 00:40.333
This phrasing works
because it eliminates hesitation

00:40.333 --> 00:43.666
ties to market data and ensures
execution feasibility.

00:44.500 --> 00:47.500
Leadership expects
you to have already assessed risks.

00:47.533 --> 00:50.533
A strong response acknowledges
challenges upfront.

00:50.900 --> 00:53.233
Execution speed is our biggest risk.

00:53.233 --> 00:55.933
Scaling
too quickly could overextend resources,

00:55.933 --> 00:58.800
leading to delays and increased costs.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.000
This works because it's specific, focuses

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
on business impact, and shows proactive
thinking.

01:04.433 --> 01:07.166
Leadership
needs to know how you'll control the risk.

01:07.166 --> 01:11.166
A strong response
is we mitigate this with a phased rollout.

01:11.433 --> 01:14.166
Prioritizing high revenue regions first.

01:14.166 --> 01:16.000
This allows us to scale gradually.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.833
Ensuring execution remains on track
while maintaining operational efficiency.

01:20.700 --> 01:23.666
This works because it's
a clear, actionable plan aligned

01:23.666 --> 01:25.733
with financial strategy.

01:25.733 --> 01:28.733
Every decision must connect to leadership
priorities.

01:28.866 --> 01:31.366
A strong response sounds like this.

01:31.366 --> 01:34.366
This strategy aligns
with sustainable growth and profitability.

01:35.133 --> 01:39.200
A phased rollout minimizes financial risk
while ensuring steady market penetration.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.200
This works
because it mirrors leadership language

01:42.200 --> 01:45.200
and reinforces risk conscious decision
making.

01:45.400 --> 01:48.400
Bottom line
leadership wasn't just listening.

01:48.466 --> 01:50.000
They were assessing whether your decision

01:50.000 --> 01:53.400
was clear, strategic
and aligned with business priorities.

01:54.133 --> 01:56.600
Strong answers drive action.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.266
Anything less creates hesitation.
