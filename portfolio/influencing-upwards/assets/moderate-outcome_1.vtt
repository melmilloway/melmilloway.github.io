00:05.133 --> 00:07.033
We considered your approach.

00:07.033 --> 00:10.033
There are some strong elements,
but LRA isn't fully aligned yet.

00:10.433 --> 00:13.433
We need more confidence and execution
before moving forward.

00:13.800 --> 00:17.100
You're thinking aligned with key
priorities, but LRA is questioning

00:17.100 --> 00:20.466
whether this plan gives us enough
competitive advantage or risk mitigation.

00:21.333 --> 00:23.600
We need a stronger case before committing.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.633
Revisit the execution details.

00:25.633 --> 00:27.133
Strengthen the argument.

00:27.133 --> 00:30.133
We'll reassess
once we have a clearer picture.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.166
It looks like a Laura is pinging you.

00:32.166 --> 00:32.866
You better go.
