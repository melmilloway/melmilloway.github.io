00:05.500 --> 00:06.100
So you think

00:06.100 --> 00:09.100
we should launch our precision
agriculture model globally,

00:09.200 --> 00:12.200
securing market leadership
before competitors catch up?

00:12.800 --> 00:17.000
Rapid global expansion would make us
the first mover in precision agriculture.

00:17.633 --> 00:20.100
Investors love first movers.

00:20.100 --> 00:22.166
Competitors fear them.

00:22.166 --> 00:25.166
Markets react to them.

00:25.433 --> 00:28.433
But aggressive scaling introduces
aggressive risk.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.600
Supply chain deployment resources.

00:31.766 --> 00:33.733
Market adaptation.

00:33.733 --> 00:36.633
If this fails, it fails loudly.

00:36.633 --> 00:38.366
How do you propose we handle that risk?
