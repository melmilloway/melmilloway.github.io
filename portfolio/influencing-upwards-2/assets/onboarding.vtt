00:05.100 --> 00:07.433
Welcome to Galaxia Analytics

00:07.433 --> 00:10.666
where data is everything
and time is a myth.

00:11.466 --> 00:14.366
I take it your analyst number 49.

00:14.366 --> 00:16.266
Or was it 48?

00:16.266 --> 00:17.366
No matter.

00:17.366 --> 00:19.200
Your credentials are active.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.200
You exist. That's what matters.

00:22.233 --> 00:26.533
As you know, our leadership team
consists of visionaries, disruptors

00:26.766 --> 00:31.000
and spreadsheet enthusiasts who thrive on
bold, confident recommendations.

00:31.633 --> 00:34.633
They want insight, not explanations.

00:34.866 --> 00:37.866
Decisions, not data dumps.

00:37.966 --> 00:42.333
And yet they demand all the data
instantly.

00:43.533 --> 00:45.266
Your challenge.

00:45.266 --> 00:46.833
Take everything you know.

00:46.833 --> 00:51.200
Simplify it and make it compelling enough
that leadership pays attention.

00:52.266 --> 00:55.133
Yes, it's a skill,

00:55.133 --> 00:58.133
one that takes practice
and the right approach.

00:58.233 --> 01:00.133
This is your first challenge.

01:00.133 --> 01:04.600
You're about to meet Cassian Rho,
analyst manager number 433.

01:05.300 --> 01:06.400
He's your manager.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.300
Or at least the system has designated him
as such.

01:09.300 --> 01:12.200
Cassian knows what leadership expects,

01:12.200 --> 01:15.466
and more importantly,
he knows how to get them to listen.

01:16.366 --> 01:19.166
He'll be preparing you
to meet Elara,

01:19.166 --> 01:22.133
otherwise known as executive Number one.

01:22.133 --> 01:25.033
She will be making the final call
on this strategy,

01:25.033 --> 01:27.700
and she doesn't have time for uncertainty.

01:27.700 --> 01:29.966
Cassian will tell you more about her,

01:29.966 --> 01:32.966
what she values, what she expects.

01:33.066 --> 01:35.500
Consider his insights carefully.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.633
Let's see how well you can make your case.

01:37.633 --> 01:38.666
No pressure.

01:38.666 --> 01:41.933
It's just an opportunity
to influence decisions that matter.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.933
And remember. Analyst number 49.

01:44.933 --> 01:48.466
Everything here is designed
to help you well, succeed.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.966
At least that's what the system says.
